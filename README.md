# Waco-Half-Ironman-Analysis
## This was a data analysis project I worked on in preparation for my Half-Ironman in October 2022 in Waco, TX. I pulled 3 years of race data to get a sense of what top winning times were, which events mattered the most, and how I might compare to other atheletes. Preliminary questions I'm working on can be found  [here](https://github.com/snoejovich/Waco-Half-Ironman-Analysis/blob/main/FinalPostWriting.ipynb).
